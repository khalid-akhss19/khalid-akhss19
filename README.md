## 🔐 About Me

𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝘁𝘆 & 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 (𝗜𝗔𝗠) 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁 | 𝗦𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗽𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁, 𝗢𝗻𝗲 𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗿, 𝗢𝗸𝘁𝗮 & 𝗣𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗙𝗲𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲

I design and deploy secure, scalable IAM solutions that empower enterprises to protect identities without friction. With 𝟯 𝘆𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 (1+ year focused on SailPoint, One Identity Manager, PingFederate & Okta), I specialize in implementing identity governance and access management solutions, from SSO integrations and MFA to JML workflows, access certifications, provisioning automation, RBAC design, and SoD policy implementation.


🛡️ Core Responsibilities:

• **𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 & 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻** – Partner with business and application teams to assess current identity processes, recommend best practices, and design solution documents. Guide stakeholders from "as-is" to "to-be" state through roadmaps balancing security, compliance, and user experience.

• **𝗜𝗚𝗔 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 & 𝗚𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲** - Architect identity governance frameworks using SailPoint and One Identity Manager, including access workflows, provisioning/deprovisioning, certifications, role mining, RBAC modeling, and SoD enforcement for least privilege and compliance.

• **𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗵𝗼𝗹𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 & 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:** – Collaborate with application teams (Salesforce, ServiceNow, Jira) to gather requirements, select authentication protocols (SAML/OIDC/OAuth), and plan phased onboarding strategies.

• **𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗢𝗻𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 & 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:** – Configure SSO integrations, implement automated provisioning via SCIM, customize login workflows, and establish lifecycle management for seamless user experiences.

• **𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗿𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 & 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲:** – Partner with IT ops on AD/LDAP syncs, certificate management, system patching, and infrastructure hardening to maintain availability and regulatory adherence.

• **𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 & 𝗧𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗲𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴:** – Resolve complex issues—MFA failures, sync conflicts, authentication errors, access denials—across L1-L3 tiers, ensuring minimal business disruption.


For me, IAM isn’t just technology—it’s about **enabling people** securely. My background in **Computer Science, Web development** gives me a unique advantage: I create identity solutions that are not only **secure and compliant**, but also intuitive and **user-friendly**.
