## 🔐 About Me

Hello! I’m Khalid, an Identity and Access Management (IAM) Consultant. I design and deploy secure, scalable IAM solutions that empower enterprises to protect identities without friction. With 3+ years of experience—including focused expertise in Okta, SailPoint, and PingFederate—I specialize in implementing comprehensive identity solutions, from SSO integrations and MFA enforcement to application onboarding, provisioning & deprovisioning, policy violation handling, SoD enforcement, joiner-mover-leaver (JML) processes, lifecycle management, and design documentation.


🛡️ Core Responsibilities:
• **Stakeholder Management** – Partnering with application teams (Salesforce, ServiceNow, SF) to gather requirements, select protocols (SAML, OIDC, OAuth), and plan phased rollouts.
• **Application Integration** - Configuring SSO, automating provisioning (SCIM), and customizing login flows for seamless user experiences.
• **Infrastructure Oversight** – Managing AD/LDAP syncs, certificate renewals, and system patching to ensure uptime and compliance.
• **User Support & Troubleshooting** – Resolving complex issues such as MFA failures, sync errors, and access denials across L1–L3 tiers.
For me, IAM isn’t just technology—it’s about enabling people securely. My background in Computer Science, Web development gives me a unique advantage: I create identity solutions that are not only secure and compliant, but also intuitive and user-friendly.
